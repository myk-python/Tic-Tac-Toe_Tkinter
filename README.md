# Tic-Tac-Toe_Tkinter
<br>
<br>
This is pure-Python3 implentation of the game Tic Tac Toe.
<br>
<br>
Designed to be sized relative to the screen resolution and appear in the center.
<br>
It uses Tkinter and custom-made gifs of 518x518 pixels.
<br>
These can be replaced with your own gifs located in the same folder as this py file.
<br>
However, be sure that you calculate the relative size of your gifs before replacing them
<br>
or they may not fit into the window.
<br>
<br>
The code should be packagable into a stand-alone exe using PyInstaller.
